# Thoughts

- ok to start slow
- spidey sense for errors
- ok to web search for it
- cowboy vs use a library (like lit review)
- ok to have some manual steps
- without loop
- taste (code, viz)
- separate content from form
- change in one place, change everywhere auto




# Intro

2023-06-14

$n = 25$ responses to poll. Percentages of experience: 38, 31, 15, 15.
About 1/3 and 2/3 split between R experience and none. Impressions
before we start: excited vs scared.

Why? Efficient, free, larger data, reproducibility, fewer errors
(manual entry), documents for others (like future you), nice reports,
flexible changes to graphs, learn other languages, connect to other
software, big community, packages.

Packages even include: interactivity, web sites, cross-stitch, memes.
Do Google it. Do need to know *how* to Google it.
